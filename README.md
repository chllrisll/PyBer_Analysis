# Pyber Ride-Sharing Data by City Type
## Pyber Analysis
We took an in depth look of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created multiple charts and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Pyber Data Results
The data below will show differences in Pyber's ride sharing data that will shed light to upper management areas of focus and more insight into fares, driver counts, and average fares by city type.

The amount of rides and amount of drivers in the Urban city type make up the majority of the Pyber volume.

## Pyber Analysis Summary
Summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Business Recommendations:

1. The Pyber ride sharing volume is consistently lucrative in high volume areas making the Urban volume the most profitable. Focus having more drivers in Urban areas 1st- then Suburban-- then Rural.
2. By focusing on Urban areas for your drivers you can capitalize on increasing ride counts and average fares.
3. From February to April incentivize drivers to drive more and for longer hours to fully account for spikes in volume.
